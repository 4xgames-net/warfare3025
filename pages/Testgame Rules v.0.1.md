- ## Game Components
	- The game is usually played on **Hexmaps** known from other popular titles, however if you prefer, you can setup a hexless playing area with the terrain you like and use tape measure instead. Whenever a unit may move 1Hex, simply allow it to move 1" instead.
	- You will of course need **Miniatures** to represent your units. 28mm Models, fully assembled and painted are best, but you may use other minatures or cardboard standees as proxies, as long as every participant can clearly determine which model represents which unit.
	- The game uses **twenty sided dice (D20)** exclusively, it is recommended to have at least one, where a handful is clearly preferable.
	- To track damage et altera, each unit on the board is also represented by a **unit card**, roughly 6x8 inches in size or smaller if you have really good eyes
	- **Action Token / Ticks** are best represented by poker chips or coins. It is recommended they are all of the same size to easily determine which unit card currently holds the least amount of ticks/action tokens.
	- Tokens that are placed on the map to mark *stationary/fast* units. a piece of paper inscribed on either side will do fine.

- ## Initiative
	- By taking actions, units accumulate action tokens/ticks, which are placed on their unit cards.
	- the unit with the lowest amount of ticks goes next.
	- If two units have the same amount of ticks and the order of activation is relevant, both units roll piloting and the worse result activates first. If both units achieved the same result, the lower die-roll goes first. Reroll if still tied.
	- before activation, a unit may remove all its ticks from its card and return them to the pool. this forces all other units to remove the same amount of ticks from their cards as well. Note down the amount of ticks the first unit removed and keep a total - this represents the passage of time in the game.
	- players should determine beforehand after how many ticks collected this way the game will end. In a narrative game, feel free to determine why the game ends, be it nightfall or the arrival of reinforcements or a collapsing sun etc.
	- a unit may chose to wait and do nothing. This triggers the activation of the next unit in line; skim the next units ticks as described above, where the waiting unit keeps  an amount of ticks equal to its "poor" Piloting stat (meaning at least 2)
	-
- ## Interruptions
	- coming soon
-
- ## Movement
	- gain the amount of ticks mentioned in the move action on your unit card
	- if you move less than the allowed distance, still gain all ticks
	- If the movement states A + B Hexes for C ticks, you may move up to the sum of Hexes. 
	  Moving more than A Hexes gains you a "fast" token.
	- Facing changes are free. if you end your movement with 180° reversed facing, however, you need an appropriate piloting roll.

	-
- ## Jumping
	- you may spend Thrust Point during your movement action. Movement points are spent to move horizontally, jump points are spent for vertical movement
	- 2 thrust points lift your mech up one level, you need 1 point to safely descent one level or land.
	- During jumping, horizontal movement must occur in a straight line.
	- ending your jump without paying the appropriate amount of thrust requires an appropriate piloting roll.
	  id:: 692b1723-c0da-4297-b9f2-968f3b3d4d12
	-
- ## Terrain
	- you may enter difficult terrain, like woods, rubble, swamp, water etc. without paying extra movement points.
	- Entering difficult terrain for the first time during a move action requires an *appropriate* piloting roll
	  id:: 692b143c-60a7-4878-b0a0-ea7b27729744
		- rolling poor means the unit must stop its movement roll appropriately for armor to avoid 2 points of damage
		- rolling a "none" result results taking 2 points of damage, unless an "appropriate" armor roll is made
		-

- ## Piloting Rolls
	- ((692b1271-fe08-47a6-867f-5a9149ae0e0c))
	- ((692b143c-60a7-4878-b0a0-ea7b27729744))
	- ((692b1723-c0da-4297-b9f2-968f3b3d4d12))
	- When more than one piloting roll is required (e.g. landing a jump in a forrest without spending the required jump thrust), roll with disadvantage.
	- Acquiring more than one disadvantage instantly fails the roll and make the Mech take 2 damage, resist as normal.
	-
- ## Attacking on the move
	- the active unit may combine a movement action with an attack action.
	- The attacking unit gains the larger amount of ticks of either the movement or attack action
	- *coming soon: The point of attack is anywhere along its movement path*
	- The point of attack is either at the start or the end of the movement path the unit takes
	-
- ## Cover
	- light woods, dense forests and buildings may all provide cover if the line between the attacker's hexcenter and the defender's hexcenter passes through them or along one of their borders. This includes the hex of the defender, but not the one the attacker is in.
	- a target that is adjacent to an intervening hex one level higher than the one it is standing on, benefits from cover, unless the attacking unit
	- A unit in depth-1 water is always in cover regardless of the attacking units height.
	- if there are more than 3 pieces of cover between the attacker and the target (including the defending units Hex), the line of sight is blocked and the target may not be engaged. dense forests and building hexes count double in this regard.
	-
- ## Resolving an attack
	- The attacking player chooses one weapon system (sorry alphastrike fans) and rolls a Piloting Roll to determine the result tier of their attack
	- The attacker may only choose a weapon system whose range matches the range to target or is adjacent to it
	  (meaning a target at long range may not be engaged with a weapon made for short range engagements or vice versa)
	- Depending on the situation, the defending player rolls:
		- If the target has a "**fast**" token on it or is behind **Cover**, it may roll **piloting**
		- if none of the above applies or the target feels brave, it rolls its **armor** instead
	-
	- The attacker gains **advantages** for:
		- not combining their attack with a move-action, i.e. gaining the "stationary" token
		- shooting a target with a "stationary"-token
		- using a weapon one Tier better than the targets armor (only when defender rolls Armor)
		-
	- The defender gains **advantages** for:
		- being in a rangeband adjacent to the optimal range of the weapon used
		- being "fast" (when defending with a Piloting Roll)
		- being "in cover" (when defending with a Piloting Roll)
		- having armor one Tier better than the weapon used (only when rolling Armor)
	-
	- Attacker and defender both net their advantages, then deduct them; this way, only one side, if any, rolls with **advantage**.
	- If one side comes out with two or more advantages, the other additionally rolls with **disadvantage**.
	-
	- In order to be successful, an attack must at least be "appropriate". A "poor" or "none" result does not hit even if the defense roll is even worse.
	-
- ## Weapons
	- ### Range Bands
		- near: up to 2Hx
		- short: 3Hx to 6Hx (near + 4Hx)
		- medium: 7Hx to 14Hx (short + 8Hx)
		- long: 15Hx to 30Hx (medium + 16Hx)
		- extreme: anything more.
	- ### Max Engagement Range
		- additionally, weapons will lose combat effectiveness past a certain distance. A target past this range may not be engaged with this weapon.
	- ### Weapon Traits
		- Armor Piercing: gain one advantage when defender rolls Armor
		- Rapid Fire (X): may optionallly roll up to X attacks instead of just one. gain one additional tick per attack rolled. If any attack result is "NONE" (less than poor), weapon is out of ammo and inoparable for the remainder of the battle.
		- Spread (X): gain one advantage versus "fast" targets that defend with Piloting, but only if Target is X or more Hexes away. 
		  Deal only half Damage (rounding down) and no armordamage in this case.
		- Haywire: if hit, target gains 3 ticks
		-
	- ### Weapon Table
		- This table shall provide a framework / reference point. Not that weapon stats may be altered depending on where they are installed - dual Autocannons may provide a Rapid Fire Trait, Weapons installed in arms may be used at shorter ranges etc.
		- |Name|Tier|Damage|Rangeband|maxRange|ticks/attack|traits|
		  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
		  |Autocannon/2|III|1|long|50|4||
		  |Autocannon/5|III|2|medium|30|4||
		  |Autocannon/10|IV|4|medium|20|5||
		  |Autocannon/20|IV|1|medium|15|6||
		  |Mashinegun|II|1|short|10|3|rapid fire (4)|
		  |Flamer|II|1|near|3|3|ignores fast & cover|
		  |small Laser|II|1|short|10|3|
		  |medium Laser|III|2|short|14|

- ## Damage
	- if the attack is successful and yields a result **equal to the defense** roll, mark one damage to armor
	- if the attack is successful and **one result tier better than the defence**, apply damage to the structural integrity of the target unit. Target may resist as normal
	- if the attack is successful and **two or more result tiers better than the defense**, the attacker may apply the damage directly to one of the target units components of the attackers choice, including srtuctural integrity but excluding the Pilot (for now). Note that no resistance roll is made in this case.
- ## Falling and prone units
	- not right now
- ## Setting up the game
	- All units begin the game outside the map on opposing short sides And move onto the battlefield on their first activation. Make opposed piloting rolls to determine who starts.
	- TODO *In later stages, every unit will have a starting amount of ticks on them depending on the scenario, the speed of the unit, the tactic and other factors.*
