- ### Resisting Damage
	- Most of the time, a unit may attempt to resist incoming damage; this represents times when a shot passes through the target without doing any signifficant damage, near missing or minor damage being spread out over several hit locations on a bigger target.
	- Roll a Toughness or Structural Integrity test, taking preexisting damage into account. Avoid all damage if the result is #poor / #appropriate / #good depending on the tier difference of weapon and the targets structural integrity or toughness.
	- certain types of attacks may exploit a vulnerability of the target or be less effective against it. Add or substract to the requirement accordingly, meaning a shot may automatically deal damage or not at all.
-
- ### Single Hitpoint Units
	- some units may be too small to individually track damage for them, Infrantry soldiers for example. Those units are considered neutralised and removed from the game once they fail their resistance roll once.
	- Prior to rolling, apply the incoming damage temporarily and count all rolls that exceed (20-Damage) as #not successfull. If the unit survives, the temporary damage is removed, as the unit does not have a damage track to note it down to.
-
- ### Non-resisting targets
	- TODO individual components which receive damage by called shots do not get a resistance roll. damage is applied to them directly once the armor is breached. This prevents Centerpiece units from too elevated levels of survivability and makes called shots a tactical option. See [[Centerpiece units]] for details.
