| stationary (harder to spot) | -1 |
| fast (easier to spot) | +1 |
| forest Hex (including occupied by target) | -1 |
| dense forest or buildings* | -2 |
| partly obscured (half cover) | -1 |

	- * if there is anything else in the line of sight additionally to one dense forest or building hex, the LOS is blocked
	- * if the buildings are lower than the target (e.g. level 1 buildings and a mech), the buildings count as partial cover instead.
