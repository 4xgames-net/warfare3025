- ### Preamble
	- Warfare3025 distinguishes two types of attack, ranged attacks (typically performed by ranged weapons) and close quarters attacks, in which agility is more important than precision and the attacker usually moves more than just the weapon. close quarters combat can therefore also be executed with a ranged weapon.
- ### Overview
	- In order to hit a target with a ranged attack, the difficulty depends on three factors, distance to target, the target speed and how carefully aimed the shot is - take the worst of the three.
- ### Distance
	- a big target at close range is much easier to hit than one that you can barely see in the distance. This is why, perhaps unintuitively, a #fast target is easier to see and hit than a stationary one. The fact that it is moving will be covered by the next factor.
	- Note also, that a #stationary target requires one result tier less than a moving one - meaning a close, stationary target can be hit with a #poor roll result.
	- Calculate the targets [[apparent size]] as it is done in [[Stealth and Detection]]
	- {{embed [[Apparent Size Modifiers]]}}
	- Hitting a target is one tier more difficult than spotting it:
		- | Distance in multiples of apparent size|required roll to hit the target*|
		  |---|---|
		  | 1x | appropriate|
		  | 2x | good |
		  | 3x | excellent |
			- * a stationary target requires one result tier less, leaving the minimal requirement at "poor"

- ### Speed
	- usually, a moving target needs an appropriate roll to hit (a stationary target only requires poor).
	- Add one difficulty tier if the target is #fast.
	- Add one difficulty tier if the distance to target exceeds the [[weapon velocity]]
- ### Aiming
	- the shooter may spend extra time aiming their gun. The more time is spent aiming, the greater the distance at which an appropriate/good attack is sufficient. Anything exceeding this distance requires an excellent shot to hit at all.
	- {{embed [[aim range and ticks]]}}
	- Note that there is a limitation of how much aiming is possible depending on the weapon itself. you can aim a blunderbus all you want, it's just not possible to hit anything deliberately past a certain range.
	- Less prominent in Mech and Vehicle combat, but a weapon that isn't properly braced (the wielder isn't strong enough) also limits the amount of ticks to be spent on aiming
	- many weapons will be stabilised and able to be fired while the attacking unit is moving. when performing a move action, the unit may, during its move, fire and use the amount of ticks found under " [[Stabilisation]] ".

		  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
		  A unit has a move action to move 4 hexes for 5 ticks and a weapon stabilisation of 3 - at any point during it's movement path, it may opt to fire with a maximum aimtime of 3 ticks, free of charge - it only pays the 5 ticks of its movement.
		  #+END_EXAMPLE
		- #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
		  A (very hypothetical) unit has a quick movement action of 1 Hex for 2 ticks  and a weapon stabilisation of 4 - it may move it's one hex for 2 ticks and simultaneously fire it's weapon with *no more than 2 ticks* worth of aiming. it may, however, opt to slow its movement and pay 5 ticks for 1 Hex - in that case, all 5 ticks may be used aiming.

- ### Aimed Shots
	- TODO Increase the required result by one tier in order to aim for one arm& side Torso or the legs. increase the required result by two in order to aim for head/cockpit. Damage to these components will be more dificult to resist, but still unsure if there should be individual armor. See [[Centerpiece units]]
