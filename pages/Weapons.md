- ### Overview
- ### Lasers
	- TODO lasers need one result tier more to deal their full potential. If not, their weapon tier and damage is halved
	- No weapon velocity, range is never considered when calculating to-hit of a moving target
- ### Cannons
	- TODO May have a RoF and recoil stat. May attack up to RoF times per action, but loses one tick of aim when recoil is surpassed
	- TODO PPCs may have static discharge effect, possibly damaging sensors
- ### Low Projectile velocity
	- TODO attacks like artillery or LRM place a token on the hex they're aimed at and resolve their attack on their turn
- ### Missiles
	- TODO shooter rolls attack in order to achieve lock. If successful, Missiles attack according to [[Close Quarters Combat]]
	- TODO LRMs may be resolved as a low velocity attack
