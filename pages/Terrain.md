- ### Movement
	- Every unit has at least one movement act
	- Terrain does not automatically slow units down; especially bold or desperate pilots may opt to take additional risk and traverse dangerous terrain at full speed. What the pilot risks depends on the movement mode of the vehicle and the terrain in question. See the Table below for more details.
