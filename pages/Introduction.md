- ### What is this sh*t?
	- I always loved Batletech, but was never really keen on playing it - and that was not even mainly because I never had a lot of friends to play with. A 4vs4 would be doable, but anything better would be a serious time commitment and require space I could rarely provide (at least for the time required). And while it was cumbersome and seem to have a table for any battlefield occurrence imaginable, I often felt it made concessions on the wrong end. Why is the left arm of an Urbanmech or a locust exactly as difficult to hit as one of an atlas 
	  Why does the atlas risk skidding and falling when going more than 30kph, while a spider can easily move and jump around at 80kph unimpeded
	  Why would a heavy mech almost always be a better choice than a lighter one
	- So I started thinking about what I wanted from a game of battletech:
		- Obviously, the game should rely less on looking up tables and be simpler to play
		- It should keep its very detailed approach - playing alpha strike without ever knowing what weapons your mechs had never satisfied me
		- It should be better scalable. While detailed mech combat is great, being able to resolve the larger conflicts described in the books wasnt really possible. The digital games let you fight battles of some importance, but you never really field more than 4 machines.
		- Not only I should be interested in being able to play solo, without a human oponent. Or maybe I really am the only one wanting to play like that - even more reason to make the game fully solo-playable, nay - solo first.

- ### What's in it (for me)
	- Currently, the barebone rules should be there to play a game of tactical mech combat. At the moment, we're in the wording phase and prove the concept. Does this all make sense? Is it as playable as I think it is? Are you able to understand all the rules even if you haven't been living inside my head for the last 20 years`?
- ### What's next?
	- Once proving and proofreading has reached an acceptable level, I want to add units of less battlefield focus - tanks with just one set of health and skill instead of the detailed subsystems of mechs and also take this even one step further and add units that only live or died - light vehicles, infantry squads etc. This will be the groundwork to increase the scale of the battles playable.
- ### What else?
	- I want all units to be AI controlled, depending on the role the player(s) have given them and the battlefield situation. This feature is highly optional, but in my mind it will be interesting to see how a battle unfolds if all players only interact with it indirectly by giving orders and letting an algorithm control their units.
	- It might even be possible for players to not even control one side of a conflict, but following secret agendas (this unit must survive, this target must be destroyed etc...)
	- Once the distinction and the mechanics for main, extra and common units are crisp enough, conversion rules will make it possible to convert one into the other, so you can play battles with more, but less detailed mechs, mech lances (handled the way infantry is currently) even.
