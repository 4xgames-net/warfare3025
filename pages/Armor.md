- ### Overview
	- When a shot connects with a target [[weapon tier]]s are compared and an armor roll is made to see wether damage can be prevented.
- ### Weapon and Armor on Equal Tier
	- Armorroll needs to be #appropriate or better in order to prevent all damage
	- an armor piercing attack requires a good armor roll to prevent damage
- ### Weapon is one Tier lower than Armor
	- smaller weapons have only minimal chance to deal damage to a target they are not designed to defeat; only when the armor roll turns up to #not protect, a lucky hit was achieved or the previously damaged armor circumvented.
	- armor piecing attacks require an appropriate armorroll in order to do damage
- ### Weapon is one Tier higher than Armor
	- Armor will most likely be overwhelmed by a hit like this, but there is a chance it achieves an #excellent roll and prevents damage
- ### Weapons and Armor of widely different tiers
	- If the difference between weapon and damage is two or more tiers, the target suffers instant destruction or is unharmed respectively.
