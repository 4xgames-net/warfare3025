- despite its naming, the weapon velocity is a distance - the distance the projectile travels in 0.5 ticks.
- if a non-stationary target is further away than this range, the difficulty increases by one tier (appropriate -> good -> excellent -> impossible)
- Lasers therefore don't have a weapon velocity and do not modify the requirement further
