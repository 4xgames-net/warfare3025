- ### Overview
	- In warfare3025, units can be #hidden, #detected or #visible.
	- Going into stealth is a deliberate action, as is detecting enemy units, meaning a unit does not decrease its stealth status on its own activation - only by being interrupted and detected during the interruption.
	- A units stealth-status may not be altered by more than one step during one activation; this means that a hidden unit becomes spotted first, even if an enemy unit moves into clear line of sight of the hidden unit. This represents surprise and ambush situations. At the same time, a unit may not simply disappear into thin air, but must spend some time being #detected.
	- A unit may try to go into stealth as soon as it profits from any kind of cover. That means, as long as there is an unobstructed LOS between the unit and an enemy, it is impossible to improve the unit's stealth.
- ### Apparent size and Visual range
	- To determine wether an object detectable or can go into hiding, its apparent size is determined by taking the actual size of the object and modiying it according to the table below.

	- Objects within [[apparent size]] Hexes are spotted automatically, up to twice the apparent size requires an appropriate sensors check, three times a good one and in order to spot a target up to 4 times their apparent size in hexes away requires an excellent sensors check. Note that an unobstructed LOS decreases the targets stealth automatically.
	- Conversely, a unit may improve its stealth status by rolling a piloting check:
