### Overview
This system replaces traditional modifier-based dice rolls with a category-based outcome resolution on a d20. The result of a roll is not just a number, but a quality of success or failure mapped into one of five outcome categories.

Instead of modifying rolls, unit skill affects how many die faces are allocated to each category — more skill compresses the failure range and expands the success ranges.

- ### Outcome Categories
  
  | Outcome       | Value | Description                          |
  |---------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
  | Bad           | 0      | Task fails, maybe even critical failure.      |
  | Poor          | 1      | Weak or compromised success.         |
  | Appropriate   | 2      | Adequate, functional, expected result.|
  | Good          | 3      | Strong or efficient success.         |
  | Excellent     | 4      | Exceptional, best-case scenario.     |
  
  These numeric boundaries vary by unit skill. A skilled unit has fewer "Bad" outcomes and more "Good" or "Excellent" ones.

- ### Simplified Notation
  
  For brevity, skill tables may use shortened notation to define result thresholds. For example:
  
  `3+/7+/15+/19+`
  
  This shorthand maps d20 results directly to outcome categories:
	- 3+ → At least "Poor"
	- 7+ → At least "Appropriate"
	- 15+ → At least "Good"
- 19+ → "Excellent"
  
  This format makes it easier to reference skill ratings and expected outcomes at a glance. It also saves a lot of space.

- ### Adjusting the Table (Optional/ Campaign game stuff)
  When a unit improves a skill:
	- It transfers one die face from a worse outcome to a better one.
	- Each outcome must have at least 1 die face.
	  
	  Example progression for Fire Control:
	  
	  | Skill Level | Bad | Poor | Appropriate | Good | Excellent |
	  |-------------|-----|------|-------------|------|-----------|
	  | Novice      | 5   | 5    | 6           | 3    | 1         |
	  | Trained     | 3   | 5    | 7           | 3    | 2         |
	  | Veteran     | 2   | 4    | 7           | 4    | 3         |
	  | Elite       | 1   | 3    | 6           | 6    | 4         |

- ### Uses in the Game
- #Stat Checks (mobility, fire control, command)
- #Damage Mitigation (staying operational for common units)
- Spotting or #Recon Tasks
- Advanced Actions (repairs, hacking, etc.)

- ### Advantages
- Clean, narrative-friendly resolution
- Uses one die, thereby allowing to roll several attacks at once (e.g. by an infantry unit)
- offers a similar range of outcomes as a D6 but
- ... offers more granularity for individual skill
- Avoids modifier-stacking clutter
