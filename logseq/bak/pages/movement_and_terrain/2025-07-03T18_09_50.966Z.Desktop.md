- **1 TP** → +1 Hex to horizontal range
- **2 TP** → +1 Height Level (≈6m) for vertical movement or safe descent
- ### Jump-Augmented Movement Rules
- Jump-augmented movement must be made in a **straight line**.
- A **Piloting Roll** is required upon landing, using the terrain’s required tier for the destination hex.
- **Failure:** The unit falls prone and takes **2 damage** to its Movement subsystem (or Structure if none).
- **Careful Landing:** Spend **+2 Ticks** to reduce the required tier by 1.
- **Interruptibility:** Jump-augmented actions are **interruptible** using the standard rules. Interrupts may occur mid-jump (before landing).
