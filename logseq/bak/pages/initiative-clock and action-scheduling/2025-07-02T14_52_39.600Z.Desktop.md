## Initiative Clock & Action Scheduling
- ### Overview
  
  Warfare 3025 replaces traditional turn cycles with a **token-based initiative system**. Each unit accumulates **Initiative Tokens (Ticks)**—physical markers on the unit or its card—based on its **Initiative Rating (INI)** and the **complexity of actions** it performs. The unit holding the **fewest tokens** is always next to activate, creating a fluid, real-time flow of play.
- ### Core Concepts
- **Initiative Tokens (Ticks):** Represent time and effort. Units add tokens as they act; the unit with the lowest total is selected for activation.
- **Initiative Rating (INI):** A static value reflecting unit speed and training. Lower INI units receive fewer tokens for each action, activating more frequently.
- **Action Tick Cost:** Every action—movement, attack, ability—has an associated tick cost based on its complexity and unit characteristics.
- ### Global Token Reduction
  
  To model the passage of time and synchronize all units, after each activation players may **reduce every unit’s token count** by the **minimum token total** on the battlefield (i.e., the active unit’s tokens). This mechanic also advances the **Global Clock** and can trigger time-based events.
  
  1. **Determine Reduction Value:** Identify the lowest token count among all units (the active unit’s total).
  2. **Subtract Tokens:** Remove that many tokens from each unit (to a minimum of zero).
	- If a unit was overlooked and has fewer tokens than the active unit, simply clear its tokens entirely.
	  
	  > **Example:** The active unit has 3 tokens—the lowest on the table. Subtract 3 from every unit: a mech with 6 tokens drops to 3; a forgotten unit with 2 tokens goes to 0.
- ### Global Clock
  
  A separate **Global Clock** tracks overall scenario time, increasing by the same number of tokens removed during each Global Token Reduction. This cumulative measure drives battlefield-wide events:
- **Reinforcements:** Arrive when the Global Clock reaches predefined thresholds.
- **Sunset/Darkness:** Initiates visibility penalties or night-ops rules at specific Global Clock values.
- **Artillery Barrages:** Execute when countdown timers (set in Global Clock ticks) expire.
- **Mission Deadlines:** Evaluate victory conditions once the Global Clock surpasses mission time limits.
  
  **Global Clock** starts at zero and only increments during Global Token Reductions, ensuring a consistent, scenario-spanning measure of elapsed time independent of individual activations.
- ### Interruption
  
  At any time, if a unit (**Unit A**) performs an action **within line of sight** of another unit (**Unit B**), **Unit B may declare an Interruption**, attempting to respond before the action completes.
- #### Conditions for Interruption:
- Unit B must have **line of sight** to Unit A during any part of the action.
- Unit B’s current Initiative Token count must be **lower than Unit A’s projected total** after completing the declared action.
- Interruption must be declared **before, during, or immediately after** Unit A’s action resolves.
- Only **enemy actions** may be interrupted.
- Each action may only be interrupted **once** and by a **single unit**.
- An interruption **cannot be interrupted**.
- #### Resolving Interruptions:
- Unit B immediately performs a **single valid action** (e.g., attack, move, take cover, deploy countermeasures).
- Unit B then gains Initiative Tokens **as normal** for its chosen action.
- If Unit B’s interruption directly affects Unit A (e.g., causes damage or suppression), Unit A’s action may be **modified**, **delayed**, or **canceled**, subject to GM or mutual player decision.
  
  > *Example: A BattleMech with 2 tokens declares a focused attack costing 3 ticks, totaling 5. An enemy tank with 3 tokens may interrupt, since its 3 < 5.*
  >
  > *It fires a reactive shot, gaining 3 more tokens. *
- If Unit B **destroys Unit A**, Unit A's action still resolves **unless** Unit B’s **final token total (post-interruption)** is **lower** than Unit A’s **post-action total**.
- ### Activation Cycle
  
  1. **Select Unit:** Choose the unit with the fewest Initiative Tokens.
  2. **Global Reduction:** Optionally conduct a Global Token Reduction to advance time and trigger events.
  3. **Activate:** Perform one action, adding its tick cost plus the unit’s INI to the unit’s token pool.
  4. **Repeat:** Continue selecting the lowest-token unit until battle end conditions are met.
