# Ranged Attacks

Ranged attacks are resolved using the standard 5-tier roll system (Bad, Poor, Appropriate, Good, Exceptional). The final required result is determined by evaluating the following factors:

---

## Target Size and Range

To determine the **base difficulty**, divide the range to the target (in hexes) by the target’s **Apparent Size** (modified by traits and cover).

- **Band 1**: Range ≤ Apparent Size → Requires **Appropriate** result
- **Band 2**: Range ≤ 2× Apparent Size → Requires **Good** result
- **Band 3**: Range ≤ 3× Apparent Size → Requires **Exceptional** result
- **Beyond Band 3**: Attack automatically **misses**

*“Apparent Size” may be increased by:*
- +1 if target is **stationary**
- −1 if in **cover**
- Additional modifiers based on unit traits

---

## Target Movement Adjustment

Movement of the target affects difficulty:

- **Fast targets**: Always require +1 result tier
- **Moving targets** (Fast or not) at distances **greater than the weapon’s Velocity stat**: Require **+1 additional result tier**

These modifiers **stack**, making fast-moving distant targets significantly harder to hit.

## Aim Range Adjustment

The attacker may choose to spend additional ticks **aiming** before the shot. This influences the effective range at which the weapon can be used without increasing the difficulty tier.

### Aiming Rules
- If the shot is within **½ × 2ⁿ** hexes: **No penalty**
- If the shot is within **2ⁿ** hexes: **+1 tier** required
- Beyond **2ⁿ** hexes: **+2 tiers** required

Where **n** = number of ticks spent aiming.

#### Aim Distance Table
| Aiming Ticks (n) | No Penalty Range (≤½×2ⁿ) | +1 Tier Range (≤2ⁿ) | Beyond = +2 Tiers |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 0                | 0                        | 1 hex                | >1 hex             |
| 1                | 1 hex                    | 2 hexes              | >2 hexes           |
| 2                | 2 hexes                  | 4 hexes              | >4 hexes           |
| 3                | 4 hexes                  | 8 hexes              | >8 hexes           |
| 4                | 8 hexes                  | 16 hexes             | >16 hexes          |

> Example: A shooter spends 3 ticks aiming. The attack is 1 tier harder up to 8 hexes, but within 4 hexes there is no penalty. Beyond 8 hexes, the shot is 2 tiers harder.

## Weapon Stabilization and Aiming Cost

- A unit may aim while moving, but doing so increases the total action cost depending on the weapon's **Stabilization** value.

> **Total Action Cost** = Movement Ticks + Aiming Ticks − Stabilization

- **Stabilization** defines how many ticks of movement can be absorbed or ignored when aiming.
- Example: A unit moves 4 ticks and aims for 5 ticks. With **Stabilization 2**, total cost = 4 + 5 − 2 = **7 ticks**.
- Aiming cannot exceed a weapon’s **Max Aim Ticks** (defined per weapon).

---

## Engagement Restrictions

- **Detected** units may not normally be targeted by ranged attacks.
- Units in **adjacent hexes** may not be targeted by ranged attacks if:
  - They are **Fast** and Size ≤ 7
  - Or they are **Moving** and Size ≤ 5

Such targets are too close and agile for effective ranged tracking. Use close-quarters combat rules instead.
