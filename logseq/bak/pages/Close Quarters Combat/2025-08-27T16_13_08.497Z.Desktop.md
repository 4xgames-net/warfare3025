- all weapons have a stat to determine how well they are suited to track and engage nimble targets at close range, when  angular speed is more important than precision. this stat determines the range a fast target must be away inorder to be engageed normally . (moving targets can be engaged at half that range, rounded down.) 
  if the target is closer, the attack must be performed as a close quarters attack instead. the attack is delivered with a piloting skill roll, where the minimum engagement range in hexes is applied as temporary damage. the attack hits on an average roll, or a good roll if the target is fast.
  the targeted unit has the opportunity to directly react to this attack with their own piloting roll, given the normal conditions for interruptions are met.. if they match or exceed the attackers roll, the target may perform a move action.
  the target may also use the opportunity to counterattack. in order to do this, the attacked unit makes a piloting skill roll, taking the temporary damage from their own weapon szstems minimum engagement range into account . meeting the attackers result tier avoiids damage vut fails the counterattack, exceeding the attackers result applies the damage of the weapon in question .
