### Overview
title:: Action Economy
This game uses a **token-based activation system** in place of traditional turns. Units act individually (or in coordinated groups), gaining **Action Tokens** based on the complexity and intensity of their actions. The flow of play is determined dynamically by the number of tokens each unit has accrued.
	- **Action Tokens** represent time and effort a unit has expended.
	- The game progresses unit-by-unit, not in player turns.
- ---
- ### Action Costs
  
  Each action has an **Action Token cost**, usually between 2 and 5, reflecting how long or intense the activity is.
	- _Table: Example action cost_
		- | Action | Token Cost |
		  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
		  | Quick Move | 2 - 3 |
		  | Standard move| 3 - 5|
		  | Standard Attack | 3 |
		  | Heavy Weapon Fire / Focused Barrage | 5 |
		  | Use Advanced System (ECM, Cloak, Hack) | 3–5 |
		  | Suppressive Fire | 3 (adds tokens to **target**) |
		  | Rally / Recover / Reload | 2–4|

- ### Coordinated Activations
	- Units in the same [[command group]] (e.g., infantry platoon, tank platoon) must act as a **coordinated group**.
	- All units in a group gain the **same number of tokens** based on the group action.
	- Group actions must be **declared together** and resolved in a single step.
	  
	  ---
- ### Global Time Mechanic
  
  At any point, players may **reduce the token count of all units** by the **lowest current token total** across the battlefield.
- This represents the **passage of time** on the battlefield.
- It can be used to **trigger time-sensitive events**, such as:
	- **Sunset / darkness rules**
	- **Reinforcement arrivals**
	- **Artillery countdowns**
	- **Mission deadlines**
	  
	  > *Example: If the lowest token count among all units is 3, then 3 tokens are removed from **every unit**. A mech with 6 tokens would go down to 3; one with 3 would go to 0.*
- ---
- ### Command Abilities and Modifiers
- Special Units units may use abilities to influence token counts.
- Typical effects include:
	- **Reduce Action Token cost** of a nearby unit’s next action
	- **Remove tokens** from a unit (representing rapid orders or morale boosts)
	- **Add tokens** to an enemy unit (simulating disruption or suppression)
- These effects allow players to manage the battlefield tempo, reinforcing the importance of command and control.
  
  ---
- ### Interruption
  
  At any time, if a unit (**Unit A**) performs an action **within line of sight** of another unit (**Unit B**), **Unit B may declare an Interruption**, attempting to respond before the action completes.
	- #### **Conditions for Interruption:**
		- Unit B must have **line of sight** to Unit A at some point of the action.

- ### **4.4 Action tokens for Command Groups**
	- Units in the same [[command group]] (e.g., infantry platoon, tank platoon) share one pool of action tokens and must therefore not only stay close to each other, but also always act together.
	- Not every unit in a group must perform the same action, but no unit may perform an action that costs more than the announced ammount of tokens
- ---
-
- ### **4.5 Global Time Mechanic**
	- When activating the next unit, players may **decide** to reduce the token count of **all units** by the **lowest current token total** across the battlefield.
	- This represents the **passage of time** on the battlefield.
	-
	- It can be used to **trigger time-sensitive events**, such as:
		- **Sunset / darkness rules**
		- **Reinforcement arrivals**
		- **Artillery countdowns**
		- **Mission deadlines**
		  
		  > 
		  
		  *Example: If the lowest token count among all units is 3, then 3 tokens are removed from **every unit**. A mech with 6 tokens would go down to 3; one with 3 would go to 0.*
- ---
- ### **4.6 Command Abilities and Modifiers**
	- **Commanders** or elite units may use abilities to influence token counts.
	- Typical effects include:
		- **Reduce Action Token cost** of a nearby unit’s next action
		- **Remove tokens** from a unit (representing rapid orders or morale boosts)
		- **Add tokens** to an enemy unit (simulating disruption or suppression)
	- These effects allow players to manage the battlefield tempo, reinforcing the importance of command and control.

- ### **4.8 Interruption**
	- At any time, if a unit (**Unit A**) performs an action **within line of sight** of another unit (**Unit B**), **Unit B may declare an Interruption**, attempting to respond before the action completes.
	- #### Conditions for Interruption:
		- Unit B must have **line of sight** to Unit A at the moment the action begins.
>>>>>>> draft
		- Unit B may only interrupt if its **current Action Token count is lower** than **Unit A’s projected total** **after completing** the action.
		- Interruption must be declared **before**, **during** or **after** Unit A resolves the action's effects.
		- Only enemy actions may be interrupted
		- an action may only be interrupted once and only by one unit
		- an interruption may not be interrupted.
	- #### Resolving Interruptions:
		- Unit B immediately performs a **single, valid action** (e.g., fire, take cover, move, deploy countermeasures).
		- Unit B then adds Action Tokens **as normal** for that action.
		- If Unit B’s interruption affects Unit A (e.g., causes damage or forces suppression), Unit A’s action may be **modified**, **delayed**, or **canceled**, depending on the circumstances and GM/joint player adjudication.
		  
		  > *Example: A BattleMech with 2 tokens declares a focused attack that will cost 3 tokens, bringing it to 5. An enemy tank with 3 tokens and line of sight may interrupt, since its current 3 is less than the mech’s 5.*
		  
<<<<<<< HEAD
		  > *It fires a reactive shot, spending 3 tokens. It may damage the mech before the attack resolves.*
		- If the interruption destroys Unit A, Unit A's action will still be resolved, unless Unit B's action point total (post interruption) is lower  than Unit A's (post interruption)
		-
=======
		  *It fires a reactive shot, spending 3 tokens. It may damage the mech before the attack resolves.*
	- #### Chosing from several valid interuptions
		- Every action may only be interrupted once and by only one unit.
		- If more than one unit is eligible to interrupt, chose the action with the least action token cost.
