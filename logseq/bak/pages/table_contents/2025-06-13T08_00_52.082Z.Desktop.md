		- 1d20 Outcome Mapping
		- Skill Profiles and Distribution Tables
		- Attribute Damage Rules
- II. Battlefield Roles & Objectives
	- Unit Roles
		- Fire Support
		- Scouts
		- Flankers
		- Assault
		- Skirmishers
	- Objectives
		- Defend
		- Capture (Infantry Only)
		- Destroy
		- Escort / Evacuate / Hold
- III. Scenario Generation
	- Objective Assignment
	- Force Composition
	- Terrain & Setup Rules
- IV. Command System
	- Role and Aggressiveness Assignment
	- Unit Activation and Initiative
	- Command Abstraction Philosophy

- VI. Damage System
	- Unit Durability by Tier
	- Armor as a Rollable Stat
	- Damage Application
		- To Components (Centerpieces)
		- To General Stats (Support Units)
		- Instant Destruction Rules
	- Damage by Tier Difference
		- ±0: Normal Engagement
		- +1 / -1: Reduced or Near-Certain Damage
		- ±2: Auto-Resist or Auto-Kill
	- Attribute Damage Rules
		- Attribute HP = 20
		- Fire Control, Mobility, etc.
		- Effect on Rolls
		- Battlefield Repair & Downgrade to "Poor"
- VII. Visibility & Spotting
	- Visibility States
		- Hidden → Contact → Observed
	- Detection Is Deterministic
	- Recon Range and Signature
		- Recon Range = Spotter Capability
		- Signature = Target Visibility Rating
		- Modified by Movement, Camouflage, etc.
	- Detection Formula
		- `Range ≤ ReconRange × Signature → Detection`
	- State Persistence and Change Rules
	- Weapon Fire Degrades Stealth
		- Fire Signature by Weapon
		- Automatic Contact
		- Observed Threshold Trigger
		- Reset at End of Activation
- VIII. Special Mechanics
	- Point Defense Logic
		- Target Size × MER vs. Range
		- Determines Eligibility to Engage
	- Advanced Targeting
		- Subsystem Targeting (Centerpieces Only)
		- Effects of Oversized Dispersion Areas
	- Suppressive Fire & Area Effects
		- Visibility Impacts
		- Signature Increase in AOEs
	- Snapshot Limitation Rules
