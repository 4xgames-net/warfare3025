#### **1. Game Overview**
	- A tactical, platoon-level sci-fi wargame set in the 31st century. Players command BattleMechs, armored vehicles, and infantry squads in turn-based, combined-arms combat on varied terrain.
- #### **2. Core Concepts**
	- **Scale**: 1 unit = 1 vehicle or mech; 1 base = 5–10 infantry.
	- [[Action Economy]] : unit activations are determined by the number of **Action Tokens** they currently hold.
	- **Movement and Facing**: Units have facings and restricted arcs of fire.
	- **Hit Resolution**: d10 or 2d6-based combat rolls modified by skill, range, cover.
- #### **3. Unit Types**
	- **BattleMechs**: Humanoid or bipedal war machines with customizable loadouts.
	- **Superheavy Tanks**: Multi-turreted or high-tech land battleships.
	- **Light Vehicles**: Scouts, artillery, APCs.
	- **Infantry**: Foot soldiers with specialized roles—anti-tank, recon, engineers.
- #### **4. Sequence of Play**
  Each game turn consists of:
	- **Initiative Phase**
	- **Command Phase** (optional orders or command point use)
	- **Activation Phase** (units act alternately or via initiative-based order)
	- **Combat Resolution**
	- **End Phase** (morale checks, objectives, repairs)
- #### **5. Movement**
	- Terrain types: open, rough, forest, urban, etc.
	- Movement Points (MP) determined by unit type and speed.
	- Rules for climbing, jumping (for mechs), and road bonuses.
- #### **6. Combat**
	- **Line of Sight (LoS)** and **Range Bands** (short, medium, long)
	- **Attack Roll** = base roll + targeting modifiers – defense modifiers
	- **Hit Locations** for BattleMechs and tanks
	- Armor vs Penetration mechanics (or simplified Damage Threshold)
	- Critical hits for internal systems or mobility
- #### **7. Damage & Destruction**
	- Units track armor and internal structure
	- System damage: limbs, weapons, sensors, engines
	- Morale or suppression for infantry
- #### **8. Special Rules**
	- **Heat & Energy Management** (optional for realism, especially for mechs)
	- **ECM/ECCM and Sensors**
	- **Ammo Tracking or Abstraction**
	- **Command & Control** (bonus effects from HQ units or commanders)
- #### **9. Scenarios & Objectives**
	- Mission-based play: capture points, destroy targets, defend zones
	- Random mission generator or campaign tree
- #### **10. Unit Design Rules**   *(Optional Advanced Section)*
	- Create custom units via point cost system
	- Modular weapons, armor, movement systems
